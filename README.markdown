# ![Logo](assets/logo.gif) Protected Paste

*[Protected Paste](http://protectedpaste.com/) is a browser extension from the
creator of [Adblock Fast](https://github.com/rocketshipapps/adblockfast),
[Disconnect](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/13/former-googler-launches-disconnect-browser-extension-that-disables-third-party-data-tracking/),
and
[Facebook Disconnect](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/20/google-facebook-disconnec/)
that prevents the
[“pastejacking” exploit](https://github.com/dxa4481/Pastejacking), which would
otherwise allow a malicious webpage to copy arbitrary content to your clipboard.
The extension mitigates this threat by providing a shim to override exploitable
JavaScript methods. Protected Paste’s toolbar icon animates whenever a potential
attack is detected and stopped.*

To get started:

1. Install
[Protected Paste for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/protected-paste/[extension ID])
(an Opera port is in review).

2. Verify that installing the extension
[has patched the exploit](https://security.love/Pastejacking/) (you may have to
use your keyboard to copy, pressing **Control-C** with Windows or \*nix or
**Command-C** with OS X, to trigger an attack).

3. Follow [Protected Paste on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/protectedpaste)
or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/protectedpaste) for app news.

Protected Paste includes the
[port.js library](https://github.com/oldestlivingboy/port).
